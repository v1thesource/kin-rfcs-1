# Kin Rewards Engine RFC

As stated in the whitepaper, the goal of the Kin cryptocurrency is to create an
alternative ecosystem of digital services that is compelling for consumers, and
fair and open for developers. To achieve this goal, Kin needs to economically
align a large group of users, developers, and digital services in order to form
a robust ecosystem. We plan to do this through the Kin Rewards Engine, an
innovative economic structure that will promote the use of Kin as a common
currency, will do just that.
